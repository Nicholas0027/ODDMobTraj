City-Scale, Path-Reconstructed Trajectory Dataset of Instant Delivery Riders in Beijing
This repository contains the data and resources for "City-Scale, Path-Reconstructed Trajectory Dataset of Instant Delivery Riders," a high-resolution spatiotemporal dataset that captures the complex mobility patterns of on-demand delivery work in Beijing.

Abstract
The rapid expansion of the on-demand economy has profoundly reshaped urban mobility, yet research is hampered by the scarcity of high-resolution trajectory data for delivery riders. Here, we address this gap by presenting a city-scale, high-resolution spatiotemporal trajectory dataset of on-demand delivery riders. This dataset was generated using a path reconstruction methodology that leverages open data containing origin-destination (OD) delivery "wave" information. By simulating realistic cycling routes with a major commercial web map service, we effectively reconstructed detailed, second-by-second trajectories from sparse initial task data. The results demonstrate high fidelity, with strong correlations between our reconstructed paths and real-world travel metrics for both route distance (Pearson's r = 0.92) and duration (Pearson's r = 0.79). This publicly available resource offers an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to investigate rider behavior, model urban freight systems, and develop more efficient and sustainable city-wide logistics solutions.
